# Team 8 - Christian Kubelle, Spencer Drucker, Kushal Patel
## 1. Read through [seed ideas](https://github.com/CSC-510/Course/blob/master/Project/IDEAS.md).   
## Select 1-2 your group might want to work on.
 **FocusBot**  
 **RewardBot**
 
## 2. Describe the problems. (10 minutes).
###### a. What is the core problem each bot is trying to solve?

FocusBot is trying to solve the problem of team members easily losing focus and is a bot that helps team members stay productive. 

RewardBot is a bot that is trying to solve the core problem of coders not getting rewarded or not feeling rewarded after completing tasks such as answering 
Stack Overflow questions, posting messages, committing code to a repository, etc. 
 
###### b. Why is it a problem worth solving?

Having a tool like FocusBot to improve team membersâ€™ focus is important because it helps to increase the overall efficiency of the team. If everyone has reminders and such to get 
them to work on the project, it is more likely to get done faster and more efficiently. It also helps to improve the communication of the team members.
 
The RewardBot is also a problem worth solving because it will encourage team members to make certain contributions. Awarding members for performing actions will provide something
for the team to look forward to while they are contributing to a project/event.

## 3. Describe possible designs: (10 minutes).

###### a. What is the core product idea?
The core product idea of FocusBot is to have a system that uses reminders and timers to allow the user to focus more on their task. 
It will also communicate with other team members and provide updates of tasks that are completed or need to be completed. 

The core product idea for RewardBot is to implement a system that randomly rewards a team member that performs a certain task
(answering Stack Overflow questions, posting messages with certain keywords, commiting code to a repo, etc). The more that a member contributes, the higher their chances become 
to obtain the award. The award is represented as an emoji on the profile that relates to and represents the task that they received the award for.

###### b. What are patterns that might be useful?
Patterns for FocusBot that might be useful are timers, reminders, and chat boxes.  
Patterns for RewardBot that might be useful are commenting on team members posts and using emojis.
